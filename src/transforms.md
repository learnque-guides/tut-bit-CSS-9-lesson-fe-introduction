# Transforms
Transform let's for use to:
* Manipulate elements using transforms for performant transitions and animations.
* Adding a "bounce" effect to a transition.
* 2D&3D transforms.

P.S.

Transforms cannot be applied to inline elements like `<span>` or `<a>`. To transform such an element, you must either change the display property to something other than inline (such as inline-block) or change the element to a flex or grid item (apply display: flex or display: grid to the parent element).
