# Transitions

* Bringing motion to the page with transitions
* Understanding timing functions and choosing the right one

Transitions examples:

* Elements can fade out. 
* Menus can slide in. 
* Colors can shift from one value to another.

*Transitions are done with the `transition-*` family of properties.*
